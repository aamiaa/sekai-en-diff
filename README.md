# sekai-en-diff

This repository automatically tracks changes to the game's master data and some api objects.

This is mainly used as a (hopefully) more reliable version of [Sekai-World/sekai-master-db-en-diff](https://github.com/Sekai-World/sekai-master-db-en-diff) for projects like https://seka.ing, as Sekai-World is mostly jp-focused and can sometimes take time to update their en repo for the game's updates.
